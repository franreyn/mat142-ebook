  <h3>Normal Distribution</h3>
  <p>One of the things we have looked at in the descriptive statistics sections is a way to describe a particular set of data, whether it be quantitative or categorical (qualitative). A next step we can take is to classify what type of distribution the data may have come from (this allows us to answer very interesting questions about the population). We will focus our time on this concept by looking at a very common distribution named the Normal Distribution. The normal distribution is recognized with its characteristic bell shape, but not all bell shaped distributions must be a normal distribution. The distribution itself only needs the mean and standard deviation to completely describe its shape and properties.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Normal Distribution </h4>
    <p>The <strong>normal distribution</strong> is a symmetric distribution in a shape of a bell (sometimes called the bell curve). It is described by the parameters of the mean &mu; and standard deviation &sigma;. The graph below shows how the bell shape and parameter values identify key portions of the graph on how the bell turn at key points for the shape. The peak of the bell occurs at the mean for the distribution and the graph turns in concavity one standard deviation away from the mean in both directions.</p>
    <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="../../images/chapter-2/2-5/normal-distribution-with-mean-standard-deviation-marks.gif" alt="The normal curve is shown over a horizontal axis. The axis is labeled with points m-3s, m-2s, m-1s, m, m+1s, m+2s, m+3s.  Vertical lines connect the axis to the curve at each labeled point. The peak of the curve aligns with the mean point m. The curve changes concavity at m-s and m+s points" width="537" height="311" border="0"></figure>
  </div>
  <p>The Normal Distribution plays an important role in many inference procedures in Statistics. We will study some of the properties of the Normal Distribution to give you an idea of what we can say once we are able to identify clearly what the distribution of a variable is from a population. Just keep in mind just because a graph looks bell shape doesn't necessarily mean it will be in general a normal distribution that describes the data.</p>
  <p>Strictly speaking, it is not correct to talk about "the normal distribution" since there are many normal distributions. Normal distributions can differ in their means and in their standard deviations. Figure 1 shows three normal distributions. The green (left-most) distribution has a mean of -3 and a standard deviation of 0.5, the distribution in red (the middle distribution) has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and the distribution in black (right-most) has a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 3. These as well as all other normal distributions are symmetric with relatively more values at the center of the distribution and relatively few in the tails. </p>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <figure><img src="../../images/chapter-2/2-5/varieties-of-normal.gif" alt="3 different normal distributions showing the heights and widths can be very different from each other, but all keep a bell shape curve even though the bells can be very narrow and very wide." width="394" height="327" border="0">
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Normal distributions differing in mean and standard deviation. </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>Some features of normal distributions are listed below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Normal distributions are symmetric around their mean. </li>
    <li>The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are equal. </li>
    <li>Normal distributions are denser in the center and less dense in the tails. </li>
    <li>Normal distributions are defined by two parameters, the mean (&mu;) and the standard deviation (&sigma;). </li>
    <li>68% of the area of a normal distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean. </li>
    <li>Approximately 95% of the area of a normal distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean.</li>
    <li>Approximately 99.7% of the area of a normal distribution is within three standard deviations of the mean.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each different choice of specific numerical values for the pair &mu; and &sigma; gives a different bell shaped curve. The value of &mu; determines the location of the center for the curve, as shown in Figure 2 "Bell Curves with different values of &mu;". In each case the curve is symmetric about µ.</p>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <figure>
      <figcaption>Figure 2. Normal distributions with different means, but the same standard deviation.</figcaption>
      <img src="../../images/chapter-2/2-5/normal-distribution-different-means.gif" alt="3 different normal distributions showing different mean values of -2, -1, and 1." width="545" height="323" border="0"> </figure>
  </div>
  <p>In figure 2 the standard deviation was the same for each normal distribution, but only the mean was changed. What we see is that the mean determines where the center of the distribution is, but doesn't change with width or spread of the distribution. Visually it appears the distribution is just a copy of each other shifted left or right depending on the value of the mean.</p>
  <p>The value of &sigma; determines whether the bell curve is tall and thin or short and squat, subject always to the condition that the total area under the curve be equal to 1. This is shown in Figure 3 "Bell Curves with different values of &sigma;", where we have arbitrarily chosen to center the curves at &mu; = 6.</p>

  <p>We just spent some time going over the shape of a normal distribution. Let's put some of these ideas together with an example of a population that has a normal distribution to see what we can say about the population just by knowing it is normal with a given mean. In the next topic for this page we will explore further how we can answer questions about the population by knowing it follows a normal distribution.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>Heights of 25-year-old men in a certain region have mean 69.75 inches and standard deviation 2.59 inches. These heights are approximately normally distributed. </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Construct a rough sketch of the normal distribution labeling the mean and one standard deviation from the mean on the horizontal axis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What percent of men have a height above 69.75 inches?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>The graph of the normal distribution is displayed below.</p>

Bell shaped graph with center at  69.75 with two other points to left and right of the center marked as 67.16 and 72.34. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mss2dgizqr"/></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The normal distribution is symmetric about the mean. This means 50% of the population would be above the mean and 50% of the population would be below the mean. We can conclude 50% of men have a height above 69.75 inches.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Empirical Rule (68 - 95 - 99.7 Rule)</h3>
  <p>Below is a rough sketch of a Normal Distribution along with what we know about the amount of data within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations about the mean. On the graph the peak is where the mean is (which would also be the median and mode value for the data set). These Rules apply to most Bell Shaped curves (there are some exceptions, but for the ones you will see in this course you may assume the rule applies).</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Empirical Rule (68 - 95 - 99.7 Rule)</h4>
    <p>The <strong>empirical rule</strong> or the 68 - 95 - 99.7 Rule states that for a normal distribution we are able to determine the area under the curve in regions one, two, or three standard deviations from the mean. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>About 68% of all values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
      <li>About 95% of all values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
      <li>About 99.7% of all values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>

  <p>It is helpful for any problem you work on to start with a general visual for the normal distribution and then label the values of the mean and standard deviation values to help answer questions in the application. The image below is the baseline for drawing that normal distribution as it includes 1, 2, and 3 standard deviation values below and above the mean. The areas then for each region can be taken from the image above.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>To use the empircal rule it is best to visualize the distribution along with the region we are looking for.</p>

        <p>Since 8 is 10-2 and 12 is 10+2 we can see that we are one standard deviation below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean. This means using the empirical Rule that we have 68% of the population. </p>

        <p>We will have to use the fact that the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean and the empirical rule. 12 is a score that is one standard deviation above the mean. We know two things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>50% of the population is below the mean (normal distribution is symmetric about the mean).</li>
          <li>68% of the population is between 1 standard deviation above and below the mean (empirical Rule)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since 68% is the percentage between 1 standard deviation above and below the mean we can say that

          is the percentage above the mean to 1 standard deviation away (this would be the interval from 10 to 12). Add to that the 50% below the mean (this would be the interval for everything below 10) we have that 84% of the values are below 1 standard deviation above the mean (or in context below a value of 12).</p>

        <p>We can see 6 is 2 standard deviations below the mean (6=10-2*2). The empirical Rule tells us that about 95% of the values are between two standard deviations above and below the mean, so this means 95% of the observations are between the values 6 and 14.

  <h3>Z-Scores</h3>
  <p>Can we still determine percentages of observations for a normal distribution if we are not 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations away from a mean (i.e. can we find the area under a normal distribution where the starting or ending points are not 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations away from the mean)? The answer is yes, but the methods for doing so will vary depending on what tools you have available to you. The method we will use below uses the idea of still measuring how many standard deviations away from the mean an observed data value is. That signed distance is what we will call a z-score.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Z-score </h4>
    <p>The number of standard deviations that a given value is above or below the mean from a normal distribution. We calculate a z-score by using the following formula:</p>

  <p>The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the value x is above (to the right of) or below (to the left of) the mean, &mu;. Values of x that are larger than the mean have positive z-scores, and values of x that are smaller than the mean have negative z-scores. If x equals the mean, then x has a z-score of zero.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Based on our work from Example 2 we saw that 66.0 was below the mean, so we expect to have a z-score that is negative: </p>

    <p>The z-score is approximately -1.45.</p>
  </div>
  <p>One of the things we can use z-scores for is to compare two data points from different normal distributions. What the z-score tells us is how far away the data point is from the mean of the population it is from. The further away the more extreme that data value is.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 5</h3>
    <p>Brand A tire has a mean life of 45,000 miles and a standard deviation of 4,500 miles. Brand B has a mean life of 38,000 miles and a standard deviation of 2080 miles. Suppose somebody with a Brand A tire lasts 48,000 miles while someone with Brand B tire lasts 40,000 miles. Which driver got a better deal from their tire?</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>We do notice that they both had better mileage than the mean (Brand A was 3,000 miles above the mean and Brand B was 2,000 miles above the mean). Brand A had more mileage above the mean, but does it mean it was better relative to the tires in its own population? The answer to this would depend on how far from the mean it was in a relative distance to the population's measure of spread (the standard deviation). The z-score will tell us that distance from the mean in terms of the standard deviation - we can use this to compare to the Brand B tire.</p>

    <p>The Brand B tire was further from the mean  based upon the calculated z-score (remember this calculation includes the relative size of the dispersion of the population). The person with the Brand B tire received better performance out of all Brand B tires in the population than the Brand A owner did in the Brand A population. The Brand B driver got a better deal in terms of performance of the tire in the population of Brand B tires as fewer Brand B tires would have lasted longer when compared to the Brand A tire.</p>

  <h3>Z-Score Percentiles</h3>
  <p>The idea of using a z-score was sort of introduced to solve problems relating to percentages of a normal distribution through the use of the empirical Rule (think about it - we were looking at being 1, 2, 3 for the value of a z-score in those problems). What do we do if the regions of interest on that normal distribution are not exactly 0, 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations away? We can't use our empirical rule to solve that problem and will have to rely on another method. One way to approach these types of problems is to relate the region of interest to an equivalent region of interest on the standard normal distribution. We can do this by converting key values to a z-score. </p>
  <p>How does converting a value to a z-score help us?</p>
  <p>If the data values come from a normal distribution, then these z-scores will also be a normal distribution, but this normal distribution is guaranteed to have a mean, &mu;, of 0 and a standard deviation, &sigma;, of 1. We call this the Standard Normal Distribution.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Standard Normal Distribution</h4>
    <p>A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with mean &mu;&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and standard deviation &sigma;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. It will always be denoted by the letter Z.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The way to calculate the percentage below a given z-score can be found by using a table of values from a standard normal distribution (depending on where the table comes from there are different ways to read these - we will use the table provided in the link for our calculations). Print out the pdf version for your own reference as you go through these problems.</p>
  <p><a href="../../assets/chapter-2/zscore_table.html" target="_blank">Z-Score Table</a></p>
  <p><a href="../../assets/chapter-2/ZscoreTable.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Version of Z-Score Table </a></p>
  <p>We use the table by breaking up the z-score into two parts and finding a corresponding row and column that represents that number. To break up the z-score we rewrite the number to the tenth place and then keep track of the hundredth digit. For instance z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61 is broken into z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.6 and 0.01. On the table we go down until we see 1.6 in the first column. Next we go to the right to match the column with .01. The value at the intersection of row 1.6 and column 0.01 is then recorded, so in this case 0.9463. </p>

  </div>
  <p>The value 0.9463  is the percentile for z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61. That percentile represents the percentage of the population that had a z-score below your given value. For instance z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61 tells us that 94.63% of the population has a z-score lower than 1.61. Remember the z-score is interpreted as how many standard deviation for the mean the data point was, so z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61 says that the data value is 1.61 standard deviations above the mean. The graph below gives a visual of the z-score value z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61 and the percentile region as shaded in for a standard normal distribution.</p>

  <h3>Normal Distribution Applications</h3>
  <p>Now we are ready to tackle problems related to a normal distribution. We will be looking at how to find the percentage of values that will fall within certain regions of a normal distribution. The way we can answer the questions is to identify the region of interest on a normal distribution curve. Identify any key points (start and end points for the intervals of interest). Convert those key points to z-scores and use the standard normal table to find the percentiles. From there we construct an equation (if needed) to find the percentage related to our interval of interest.</p>
  <p>In the examples that follow it is helpful to always draw the normal distribution and shade in the region of interest. This will help decide what to do with values from the standard normal table. Try not to skip the step of drawing the normal distribution as work on the additional exercises below the examples.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 8</h3>
    <p>A normal distribution has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2.5. Find the percentage of values below 14.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Start with identifying the region of interest on the normal distribution. We want to find the percentage of values that fall below the value of 14. Draw the normal distribution and label the mean. Label 14 (the key point here as we want the percentage below 14).</p>
    <p>Find the z-score:

    <p>The percentile that corresponds to a z-score of 1.60 on the table is 0.9452, so this means 94.52% of the values on this normal distribution are below a value of 14.</p>

  <p>Let us revisit the example of male heights and use the standard normal table to help us solve the question from example 2.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 9</h3>
    <p>Heights of 25-year-old men in a certain region have mean 69.75 inches and standard deviation 2.59 inches. These heights are approximately normally distributed. Find the percentage of men whose heights are below 66.0 inches.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Start with drawing the normal distribution as we did earlier in example 2 and show the shaded region we are interested in.</p>
    <div class="side-by-side"> <img src="../../images/chapter-2/2-5/normal-distribution-mens-heights-mean69.75-example2d.jpg" width="80%" alt="Normal distribution with region region below 66.0 shaded in."></div>
    <p>To find this percentage we will convert the 66.0 to a z-score. Next we will go to the standard normal table and pull out the percentage of the population that fall below the z-score. That value will give us the percent we are interested in since it corresponds to the area to the left under the normal curve. If you were looking for the percentage above we would need to take one additional step of subtracting the value from 100&#37;.</p>
    <p>With a z-score of -1.45 we go to the standard normal table and see the corresponding value is .0735 which means 7.35% of the population is below that given z-score of -1.45. We can conclude then that 7.35% of men (from the given region) have a height below 66.0 inches.</p>

    <p>We are looking for the percentage between two values under the number distribution.

      <p>If you want to use the empirical rule you have to check to see if the points of interest are exactly one, two, or three standard deviations away. The mean is 22.8 with a standard deviation of 1.1. The point of interest is 23, which is not one standard deviation above, but lower than one standard deviation above. To answer this question you will need to find the z-scores so that you are able to use the z-table to find percentages. The table won't directly answer the questions, but you can use it to build up the answer with a little work.</p>

          <p>2.5%. The 68-95-99.7 rule tells us that 95% of the data values are within two standard deviation of the mean if the distribution is normal. With a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 4 we know two standard deviations from the mean is between the values 12 and 28. We are interested in the percent of values below 12. The 95% tells us that there must be 5% in the tales of that bell shaped curve. Since the Normal distribution is symmetric about the mean the tails must share that 5% evenly and leaves 2.5% in the tale on the distribution that represents the values below 12.</p>

              <p>Answers will vary. One possible difference is that there may be a much larger drop off in drivers going 5 mph or over the speed limit and not have the same tail of a normal distribution. Same goes for speeds under the speed limit (not having as much as the normal distribution would want to predict).</p>

      <p>Suppose that weights of bags of potato chips coming from a factory follow a normal distribution with mean 12.8 ounces and standard deviation .6 ounces. If the manufacturer wants to keep the mean at 12.8 ounces but adjust the standard deviation so that only 1% of the bags weigh less than 12 ounces, how small does he/she need to make that standard deviation? Round your answer to two decimal places. </p>

        <div class="exerciseanswer">
          <p>We can use the z-score formula to find the standard deviation. First find the value for z such that 1% are fewer then it. From the standard normal table we have -2.32 for the z-score. In the z-score formula with a data value of 12, mean of 12.8 and z-score of -2.32 we will solve for the standard deviation, &sigma;.</p>
