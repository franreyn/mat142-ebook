    <h2>Basics of Loans</h2>
    <p>When someone borrows money (gets a loan) they usually do not get it for free. The typical way people pay for
      this borrowing is by paying a percentage of the amount borrowed plus some fees back to the lender. The amount
      borrowed is typically called the loan proceeds or principal amount. The amount over the proceeds that is paid
      back to the lender can be called the interest on the loan or a finance charge and represents the total cost for
      the loan. These charges may be paid upfront (like in a discount loan), paid at the end, or made with the
      payments for the length of time of the loan (also called the term).</p>
    <div class="definition">
      <p>The <strong>principal</strong> is the amount to be borrowed.</p>
      <p>The <strong>cost of the loan</strong> is the total amount of money paid back to the lender minus the
        principal. Sometimes simply referred to as the interest for the loan.</p>
      <p>The <strong>term for a loan</strong> is the total length of time before the loan must be paid back in full. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>You purchase a solar panel system with installation for $20,150 plus sales tax at the contractor rate in
        Tucson of 5.66&#37;. The solar company offers an installment loan that has payments of $376.14 per month for
        the next five years. What is the cost of the loan if all the payments are made over the entire five years?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>The cost of the loan is the difference between the total of all payments and principal of the loan. To find
        the total payments take the monthly payments of &#36;376.14 times 12 months to get an annual amount paid and
        then multiply by 5 to get the total over all five years.</p>

    <p>In many cases when buying a home the loan principal is reduced by a down payment made on the house. If a house
      was for sale at $200,000, but the bank required a 20% down payment you may be looking at a loan for $160,000 as
      the principal. In the Try it Now you will need to factor in the down payment, but we will ignore any other fees
      and costs that get added to a home loan.</p><div class="tryitnow">

    <h2>Simple Interest</h2>
    <p>There are different ways that interest can be calculated when borrowing or when investing (being the lender -
      did you know when you deposit money in the bank you are lending them that money in some sense - thats why a bank
      pays you interest on your deposits for a savings account). The first way we are going to look at is something
      called simple interest.</p>
    <p>Discussing interest starts with the <strong>principal</strong>, or amount your account starts with. This could
      be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan.&nbsp; Interest, in its most simple form, is
      calculated as a percent of the principal.&nbsp; For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to
      repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would just be 5% of 100:&nbsp; $100(0.05) =
      $5.&nbsp; The total amount you would repay would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.</p>

    <p>One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term loans. For longer term loans, it is common for
      interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned
      regularly. For example, bonds are essentially a loan made to the bond issuer (a company or government) by you,
      the bond holder. In return for the loan, the issuer agrees to pay interest, often annually. Bonds have a
      maturity date, at which time the issuer pays back the original bond value.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 4</h3>
      <p>Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You obtain a
        $1,000 bond that pays 5% interest annually that matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>Each year, you would earn 5% interest:&nbsp; $1000(0.05) = $50 in interest.&nbsp; So over the course of five
        years, you would earn a total of $250 in interest.&nbsp; When the bond matures, you would receive back the
        $1,000 you originally paid, leaving you with a total of $1,250.</p>

      <h4>APR &ndash; Annual Percentage Rate</h4>
      <p>Interest rates are usually given as an <strong>annual percentage rate (APR)</strong> &ndash; the total
        interest that will be paid in the year.&nbsp; If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will
        be divided up. </p>
      <p>For example, a 6% APR paid monthly would be divided into twelve 0.5% payments.<br>
        A 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided into four 1% payments.</p>

        interest will you earn?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>Since interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), the 4% interest will be divided into two 2%

    <h2>Discounted Loans</h2>
    <p>When a loan is made over a specified period of time, but the interest that would have been paid is deducted
      from the loan amount before it is given to the borrower we call that a <strong>discounted loan</strong>. The total interest that was deducted from the loan is called the <strong>discount</strong>. The amount that is given to the borrower and is called the proceeds.

      <p>The discount was found to be $750. This means Francisco will receive after going through the loan process
        $4250 to use. He will need to pay back the $5000 by the end of two years (so the bank is making $750 on the
        loan).</p>
      <p>If we now reverse the process we can find what an equivalent interest rate would be for a initial principal
        of $4250 to grow to a value of $5000 over two years.</p>

      <p>What we find is that the interest rate that would be charged in a simple interest rate structure is
        approximately 8.82%. This is a little over 1% above the advertised rate for a discount loan, but represent the
        equivalent rate amount if comparing to a simple interest rate loan instead.</p>

    <h2>Add On Loans</h2>
    <p>Another approach for smaller loans on items like appliances, furniture, or electronics is a loan where the
      interest is calculated for the initial principal for a set period of time. This interest is then added on to
      that principal as the amount to be paid over fixed payments during for the term of the loan (or in one lump sum
      at the end). This type of loan is sometimes seen for borrowers with very poor credit scores on cars and homes as
      well.</p>
    <div class="definition">
      <h4>Add-On or Precomputed Interest Loan</h4>
      <p>With an <strong>Add-On loan</strong> the future value <em>FV</em> (or total amount owed) is first calculated
        at the beginning by finding the simple interest for a given annual rate <em>r</em>, time <em>t</em>, and
        principal <em>P</em>. After the interest is found it is added to the principal and the payments pymts is found
        by dividing by the number of months in the term of the loan.</p>

    <p>With an add-on loan the amount of interest paid and the amount paid on the principal will be the same every
      month while making the payments. This means on the very last payment you paid the exact same amount of interest
      as you did on the first payment. If the agreement allows you to pay off the loan early you would only need to
      determine the total number of principal payments left, but many of these agreements either will not let you pay
      the loan off early or will apply a fee for early payoff of the loan.</p><div class="tryitnow">

      <p>Sam bought a new TV for $690 and stand for $350 at a home electronics store. If the sales tax in the city is
        5.7% and the store offers to finance the purchases with an add-on loan at an annual rate of 11.9% for 10
        months, then how much is the total cost of the purchase going to be for Sam and what would the payments be? </p>
      <h5 class="js-expandmore">Hint 1</h5>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>Start by finding the total amount of the purchase including sales tax. That would be the starting principal

      <h5 class="js-expandmore">Answer</h5>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>The cost of the purchase with sales tax is the principal <em>P</em> for the loan. Add the two charges and

      <li>A new washer and dryer is purchased for $1357.98 (including sales tax and delivery). Financing was used for
        the full purchase price and the payments are $137.27 per month for 12 months. What is the total cost for the
        washer and dryer and what was the cost of the loan?</li>
      <li>A new furnace and AC unit was purchased for a home. The cost for the unit (including sales tax and
        installation) was $7,981. If the payments $611.88, then what is the total cost of the loan and total cost
        for the furnace and AC unit purchase?</li>
      <li>A student took out a $60,000 loan to finish a graduate program. If the payments of the loan are $337, then
        what is the cost of the loan and what did the students pay in total for the loan.</li>
      <li>In the early 1980's the average mortgage rates hit a peak at approximately 18%. For a $100,000 loan the
        montly payment for a 30 year loan was approximately $1,507. In 2021 the morgtage rates were hitting new lows
        with 30 year loans for those with good credit around 3%. A payment for a $100,000 loan with that rate is
        approximately $422. Compare the cost of the loan from 1980s to the 2022 example.</li>
      <li>A TV is purchased and financed through an electronics store. The cost of the TV is $699.99 and there is a
        local sales tax of 8.7%. The entire purchase is financed and has a monthly payment of $64.27 for 12 months.
        What is the cost of the financing and what is the total cost of the TV purchase?</li>
      <li>A home is being purchased for $195,000. The bank requires a downpayment of 20%. If the monthly payments for
        the home are $876, then what is the total cost for the home and how much of that was interest on the loan
        (the cost of the loan).</li>
      <li>A friend lends you $200. After two weeks it is repaid with 5% interest added on to the amount
        borrowed.&nbsp;
        <ol type="a">
          <li>How much will you have to repay?&nbsp; </li>
          <li>What is the equivalent annual simple interest rate?</li>

      </li>
      <li>Suppose you obtain a $3,000 T-note with a 3% annual rate, paid quarterly, with maturity in 5 years.&nbsp;
        How much interest will you earn?</li>
      <li>A T-bill is a type of bond that is sold at a discount over the face value.&nbsp; For example, suppose you
        buy a 13-week T-bill with a face value of $10,000 for $9,800.&nbsp; This means that in 13 weeks, the
        government will give you the face value, earning you $200.&nbsp; What annual simple interest rate have you
        earned?</li>
      <li>You borrow $1000 from a friend with a promise to pay back $1300 in two years. What annual simple interest
        rate will you be paying?</li>
      <li>A pay day loan company offers a $500 short term loan that charges a fee of $25. The loan is due in 2 weeks.
        What is the equivalent annual simple interest rate for that loan? Treat the fee as the interest charged for
        two weeks.</li>
      <li>In California a payday lender can loan up to $300 and charge a maximum of $45 in fees (<a
              href="https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/payday-loans" target="_blank" >Source</a>). If that payday loan
        is for two weeks what is the equivalent annual simple interest rate for the loan? Teach the fee as the
        interest charged for two weeks.</li>
      <li>Suppose you borrow $12,000 to pay for your wedding from a bank that offers you a 6% discounted loan for a
        period of four years.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>What is the loan's discount?</li>
          <li>What is the amount of money you receive?</li>
          <li>Determine the loans actual annual interest rate (assuming simple interest).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If Dyva borrows $3,200 to help pay for this years tuition from a lender offering a discount loan with an
        annual rate of 7.13% for 12 months, then what is the proceeds received by Dyva?</li>
      <li>A bank is offering a CD that pays an annual simple interest rate of 4.5%. How much money would you need to
        invest in this CD now in order to have $2500 two years from now for a down payment on a used car? </li>
      <li>A new furnace and AC unit was purchased for a home. The cost for the unit (including sales tax and
        installation) was $7,981. If the company is offering financing with a simple interest add-on loan with an
        annual rate of 6.9% and a term of two years, then what are the monthly payments? What was the total cost of
        the purchase if that financing is used?</li>
      <li>A TV is purchased and financed through an electronics store. The cost of the TV is $899.99 and there is a
        local sales tax of 7.2%. The entire purchase is financed through the store with a simple interest add-on
        loan. If the annual rate is 10.9% and the term is 15 months, then what are the monthly payments?</li>
      <li>Assume you need a loan for $1000. If you had to pick between a discount loan with proceeds of $1000 vs a
        simple interest add-on loan where both loans are for 12 months and have an annual rate of 8%, then which
        would you pick and why.</li>
