    <h1>6.4 Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>Upon completion of this section, you should be able to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply Problem Solving Strategies to Applications</li>

    <h2>Apply Problem Solving Process and Strategies</h2>
    <p>In Chapter 0 you were introduced to some fundamental ideas for problems solving strategies based on the work
      from Polya. Below is a quick summary.</p>
    <div class="definition">
      <h3>Problem Solving Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand the Problem</li>
        <li>Devise a Plan</li>
        <li>Carry out the Plan</li>
        <li>Look Back</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Let us now look at applications that take into consideration the topics we covered in this course.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>Joseph is remoldeling a kitchen and received a quote for installation and labor of a new floor to be $105 per
        sq yard (this includes taxes). The kitchen has dimensions of 22 ft 5 in by 15 ft. In addition Jospeh will
        purchase a new Refridgerator for $2,900, range for $1,300, and a dishwasher for $899 at a local store (where
        sales tax is 8.7%).</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong> </p>
      <p>Joseph needs to finance this remodeling project. At the local bank he can get a line of credit with an annual
        rate of 7% with monthly payments with a 5 year term. Determine the total cost of the remodel, the payments for
        the loan, the cost of the loan, and the total cost of the remodel if payments are made as scheduled. </p>
    </div>
    <p>The problem above illustrates what really can be involved as we look at a general application of material you
      have worked on. We needed an understanding of how to convert units, find the area, determines sales tax, and
      find the payment amount on an amortized loan.</p>

<p>There are 2.5 servings in the container and each serving has 30 grams of sugar. This gives a total of

        grams of sugar. The 20 oz soda has

      <li>Brandon walked from Rincon/UHS to UofA. It took him 1 hour and 35 minutes. He then took 45 minutes to walk
        from UofA to Pima Downtown Campus. If he did not stop at any point and arrived at the Pima Downtown Campus
        at 4:25 pm, then what time did he leave Rincon/UHS?</li>
      <li>Abby is not a morning person and needs to plan on what time to wake up for a morning class. She needs 30
        minutes to get ready in the morning. It takes her 25 minutes to bike to campus and walk to class. If her
        class starts at 8:45 a.m. what time should she set her alarm for?</li>
