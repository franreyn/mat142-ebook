  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Many events in the world around us exhibit random patterns, but by repeated observations of such events it can often be seen to predict long-term patterns (despite random, short-term fluctuations). Probability is simply the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of these events. The probability of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur.</p>

  <p>There are several ways of viewing probability. One would be <strong>experimental</strong> (also called empirical) in nature, where we repeatedly conduct an experiment and assign the probability to be the ratio of times we observed the event to the number of trials in the experiment. Suppose we flipped a coin 1000 times and heads occurred 529 times. We could assign the probability of being a head on a flip as the ratio
    <math display="inline">

            <mn>1000</mn>
          </mrow>
        </mfrac>
      </mrow>
    </math>
    . </p>
  <p>Another approach is more <strong>theoretical</strong> in that we use logic or knowledge about the experiment to assign a probability. For our coin example we could use logical reasoning to say that each side of the coin has the same chance of landing upright when flipped, so we would assign the probability as
    <math display="inline">

        <mfrac>
          <mn>1</mn>
          <mn>2</mn>
        </mfrac>
      </mrow>
    </math>
    for being a heads. This theoretical value comes with some assumptions typically (the coin is balanced equally throughout, the player is not attempting to manipulate the toss, etc...). For those interested in how a coin flip may not be as fair as you think take a look at "<a href="The Coin Flip_ A Fundamentally Unfair Proposition.pdf" target="_blank">The Coin Flip: A Fundamentally Unfair Proposition</a>".</p>
  <p>Another view of how to assign probabilities would be <strong>subjective</strong> in nature, in other words an educated guess.  If someone asked you the probability that the Diamondbacks would win their next baseball game, it would be impossible to conduct an experiment where the same two teams played each other repeatedly, each time with the same starting lineup and starting pitchers, each starting at the same time of day on the same field under the precisely the same conditions.  Since there are so many variables to take into account, someone familiar with baseball and with the two teams involved might make an educated guess that there is a 75% chance they will win the game; that is, if the same two teams were to play each other repeatedly under identical conditions, the Mariners would win about three out of every four games.  But this is just a guess, with no way to verify its accuracy, and depending upon how educated the educated guesser is, a subjective probability may not be worth very much.</p>
  <p>We will return to the experimental and subjective probabilities from time to time, but in this course we will mostly be concerned with theoretical probability.</p>
  <h2>Sample Spaces and Events</h2>
  <p>If you roll a die, pick a card from deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their age, we say we are conducting a <strong><em>random experiment</em></strong>, an action for which all possible outcomes can be listed, but for which the actual outcome on any given trial of the experiment cannot be predicted with certainty. In probability, we look at the likelihood of an outcome or a collection of outcomes that we call an <em><strong>event</strong></em> in the random experiment.  We begin with some terminology. </p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Terminology</h4>
    <p>A <strong>random experiment</strong> is a mechanism that produces a definite outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty. The <strong>sample space</strong> associated with a random experiment is the set or collection of all possible outcomes. An <strong>event</strong> is any particular outcome or group of outcomes. When an event is made up of just one single outcome we call it a <strong>simple event</strong>.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>Construct a sample space for the experiment that consists of tossing a single coin.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong> </p>
    <p>The outcomes could be labeled <em>h</em> for heads and <em>t</em> for tails. Then the sample space is the set

    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p>Construct a sample space for the experiment that consists of rolling a standard single die. Find the events that correspond to the phrases “an even number is rolled” and “a number greater than two is rolled.”</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong>
    <p>The sample space is the set of all possible simple events:
      <math display="inline">

        </mrow>
      </math>
    </p>
    <p>The event “an even number is rolled” would be the collection of all even numbers. We will call this event E and would be:

      </math>
    </p>
    <p>The event “a number greater than two is rolled.” would be the collection of all numbers larger (greater) than 2. We will call this event F and would be:
      <math display="inline">
        <mi>F</mi>

      </math>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>The choice of the letter for an event is similar to the choice for a letter in a variable in an algebra application. We pick one that will hopefully help with the meaning of the event in terms of the application. The letter <em>E</em> was a natural choice for the event of an even number in the dice rolls, so it was used. The other event didn't have a natural choice so we picked a letter close to <em>E</em> and didn't have any inferred meaning in the application.</p>
  <p>A graphical representation of a sample space and events is a Venn diagram, as shown below "Venn Diagrams for Two Sample Spaces". In general the sample space <em>S</em> is represented by a rectangle, outcomes by points within the rectangle, and events by ovals that enclose the outcomes that compose them.</p>

  <p>A device that can be helpful in identifying all possible outcomes of a random experiment, particularly one that can be viewed as proceeding in stages, is what is called a <strong>tree diagram</strong>. It is described in the following example.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 3</h3>
    <p>Construct a sample space that describes all three-child families according to the binary genders of the children with respect to birth order. For simplicity we are only using the binary genders, but recognize there are those who identify as nonbinary.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Two of the outcomes are “two boys then a girl,” which we might denote bbg, and “a girl then two boys,” which we would denote gbb. Clearly there are many outcomes, and when we try to list all of them it could be difficult to be sure that we have found them all unless we proceed systematically. The tree diagram shown below "Tree Diagram For Three-Child Families", gives a systematic approach.</p>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="side-by-side-item">
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Tree Diagram For Three-Child Families</figcaption>
        <img src="../../images/chapter-4/4-1/tree-diagram-for-three-child-families.jpg" width="40%" alt="Tree diagram starting with b and g and each branching out to two choices of either b or g until we have branches that list out bbb, bbg, bgb, bgg, gbb, gbg, ggb, ggb, ggg."/></figure>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The diagram was constructed as follows. There are two possibilities for the first child, boy or girl, so we draw two line segments coming out of a starting point, one ending in a b for “boy” and the other ending in a g for “girl.” For each of these two possibilities for the first child there are two possibilities for the second child, “boy” or “girl,” so from each of the b and g we draw two line segments, one segment ending in a b and one in a g. For each of the four ending points now in the diagram there are two possibilities for the third child, so we repeat the process once more.</p>
  <p>The line segments are called branches of the tree. The right ending point of each branch is called a node. The nodes on the extreme right are the final nodes; to each one there corresponds an outcome, as shown in the figure.</p>
  <p>From the tree it is easy to read off the eight outcomes of the experiment, so the sample space is, reading from the top to the bottom of the final nodes in the tree,</p>

  <h2>Probability</h2>
  <p>We have mentioned earlier for empirical probability that it represents a ratio of the number of times we observed an outcome over number of trials. With that in mind we will give a more formal definition along with properties that makes sense when we think of probabilities as a ratio.</p>

    <h4>Probability</h4>

  <p>Since the whole sample space <em>S</em> is an event that is certain to occur, the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes must be the number 1.</p>
  <p>In ordinary language probabilities are frequently expressed as percentages. For example, we would say that there is a 70% chance of rain tomorrow, meaning that the probability of rain is 0.70. We will use this practice here, but in all the computational formulas that follow we will use the form 0.70 and not 70%.</p>
  <p>It is relatively straight forward to find probability is when all the outcomes have the same chance of occurring. For example experiments where each outcome has the same chance of happening would include the roll of a fair dice, flipping a fair coin, or even the results of a simple random sample from a population. Finding probabilities in these situations is just a matter or counting (as shown in the definition below).</p>

  <p>Probabilities are essentially fractions, and can be reduced to lower terms like fractions as you saw in the examples, however we may not always do this as the unsimplified fraction may contain more information when reading it then the simplified answer.

    <p>There are 20 possible cherries that could be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is 20. Of these 20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability that the cherry will be sweet is

  <p>There is one potential complication to the cherry picking example, however. It must be assumed that the probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as the probability of picking any other. This wouldn't be true if (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour ones. (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when you sampled from the bag.) Let us keep in mind, therefore, that when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable to all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal probability for all outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Probability when things are not equal likely</h2>
  <p>The previous examples illustrate how probabilities can be computed simply by counting when the sample space consists of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. In some situations the individual outcomes of any sample space that represents the experiment are unavoidably unequally likely, in which case probabilities cannot be computed merely by counting, but the computational formula given in the definition of the probability of an event must be used. </p>

  <p>In the last example the process for adding the probabilities together worked as the classifications of race/ethnicity didn't allow for any of the students to fall into more than one classification as well as all students would be captured into just one of them. If there were overlaps between two classifications we could not treat the probability question in the same way.</p>

    <p>The student body in a local high school may be broken down into ten categories as follows: 25% white male, 26% white female, 12% black male, 15% black female, 6% Hispanic male, 5% Hispanic female, 3% Asian male, 3% Asian female, 1% male of other minorities combined, and 4% female of other minorities combined. A student is randomly selected from this high school. Find the probabilities of the following events:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p><em>B</em>: the student is black,</p>
