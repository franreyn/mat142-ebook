      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Counting?&nbsp; You already know how to count or you wouldn't be taking a college-level math class,
        right?&nbsp; Well yes, but what we'll really be investigating here are ways of counting
        <em>efficiently</em>.&nbsp; When we get to the probability situations a bit later in this chapter we will need
        to count some <em>very</em> large numbers, like the number of possible winning lottery tickets.&nbsp; One way to
        do this would be to write down every possible set of numbers that might show up on a lottery ticket, but believe
        me: you don't want to do this.</p>
      <p>We encounter a wide variety of counting problems every day. There is a branch of mathematics devoted to the
        study of counting problems such as this one. Other applications of counting include secure passwords, horse
        racing outcomes, and college scheduling choices. We will examine this type of mathematics in this section</p>
      <h2>Addition Principle</h2>
      <p>A company that sells customizable cases offers cases for tablets and smartphones. There are 3 supported tablet
        models and 5 supported smartphone models. The <strong>Addition Principle</strong> tells us that we can add the
        number of tablet options to the number of smartphone options to find the total number of options. By the
        Addition Principle, there are 8 total options.</p>

        <h4>The Addition Principle</h4>
        <p>According to the Addition Principle, if one event can occur in <em>m</em> ways and a second event with no
          common outcomes can occur in <em>n</em> ways, then the first or second event can occur in

          ways.

        <p>There are 2 vegetarian entrée options and 5 meat entrée options on a dinner menu. What is the total number of
          entrée options?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>We can add the number of vegetarian options (2) to the number of meat options (5) to find the total number of
          entrée options. This gives us a total of 7 options.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Multiplication Principle</h3>
      <p>We will start with an example to illustrate the Multiplication Principle.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <p>Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or breadsticks) and
          five choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or pasta). If you are allowed to choose
          exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Solution 1</strong>: One way to solve this problem would be to systematically list each possible
          meal: <br>
        </p>
        <table class="display-lg">
          <tr>
            <td>soup + hamburger            </td>
            <td>soup + sandwich            </td>
            <td>soup + quiche            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>soup + fajita            </td>
            <td>soup + pizza            </td>
            <td>salad + hamburger            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>salad + sandwich            </td>
            <td>salad + quiche            </td>
            <td>salad + fajita            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>salad + pizza            </td>
            <td>breadsticks + hamburger            </td>
            <td>breadsticks + sandwich            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>breadsticks + quiche            </td>
            <td>breadsticks + fajita            </td>
            <td>breadsticks + pizza            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Assuming that we did this systematically and that we neither missed any possibilities nor listed any
          possibility more than once, the answer would be 15.&nbsp; Thus you could go to the restaurant 15 nights in a
          row and have a different meal each night. </p>
        <p><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Another way to solve this problem would be to list all the possibilities in a
          table:        </p>
        <table class="display-lg">
          <tr>
            <td width="9%">&nbsp;</td>
             <td width="30%"><strong>hamburger</strong>            </td>
             <td width="21%"><strong>sandwich</strong>            </td>
             <td width="15%"><strong>quiche</strong>            </td>
             <td width="12%"><strong>fajita</strong>            </td>
             <td width="13%"><strong>pizza</strong>            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>soup</strong>            </td>
             <td>soup+burger            </td>
             <td>&nbsp;</td>
             <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>salad</strong>            </td>
             <td>salad+burger            </td>
             <td>&nbsp;</td>
             <td>&nbsp;</td>
             <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>bread</strong>            </td>
            <td><em>etc.</em>            </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
         <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In each of the cells in the table we could list the corresponding meal: soup + hamburger in the upper left
          corner, salad + hamburger below it, etc.&nbsp; But if we didn't really care <em>what</em> the possible meals
          are, only <em>how many</em> possible meals there are, we could just count the number of cells and arrive at an
          answer of 15, which matches our answer from the first solution.&nbsp; (It's always good when you solve a
          problem two different ways and get the same answer!) </p>
        <p><strong>Solution 3</strong>: We already have two perfectly good solutions.&nbsp; Why do we need a
          third?&nbsp; The first method was not very systematic, and we might easily have made an omission.&nbsp; The
          second method was better, but suppose that in addition to the appetizer and the main course we further
          complicated the problem by adding desserts to the menu: we've used the rows of the table for the appetizers
          and the columns for the main courses—where will the desserts go?&nbsp; We would need a third dimension, and
          since drawing 3-D tables on a 2-D page or computer screen isn't terribly easy, we need a better way in case we
          have three categories to choose form instead of just two. </p>
        <p>So, back to the problem in the example.&nbsp; What else can we do?&nbsp; Let's draw a <strong>tree
            diagram</strong>:</p>
        <div>
         <div>
            <figure>
             
              <img src="../../images/chapter-4/4-4/module6-4-clip-image002.gif" width="50%" alt="description below">
           <figcaption>Tree Diagram for Restaurant Choices</figcaption></figure>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This is called a &quot;tree&quot; diagram because at each stage we branch out, like the branches on a
          tree.&nbsp; In this case, we first drew five branches (one for each main course) and then for each of those
          branches we drew three more branches (one for each appetizer).&nbsp; We count the number of branches at the
          final level and get (surprise, surprise!) 15. </p>
        <p>If we wanted, we could instead draw three branches at the first stage for the three appetizers and then five
          branches (one for each main course) branching out of each of those three branches.</p>
        <p><a href="http://youtu.be/fROqcu-ekkw" target="_blank" >Video Solution</a> <em> (1 min 39 secs - CC)</em> Another example
          starts after 1:39 mark on the video.</p>
      </div>
      <p>OK, so now we know how to count possibilities using tables and tree diagrams.&nbsp; These methods will continue
        to be useful in certain cases, but imagine a game where you have two decks of cards (with 52 cards in each deck)
        and you select one card from each deck.&nbsp; Would you really want to draw a table or tree diagram to determine
        the number of outcomes of this game?</p>
      <p>Let's go back to the previous example that involved selecting a meal from three appetizers and five main
        courses, and look at the second solution that used a table.  Notice that one way to count the number of possible
        meals is simply to number each of the appropriate cells in the table, as we have done above.&nbsp; But another
        way to count the number of cells in the table would be multiply the number of rows (3) by the number of columns
        (5) to get 15.&nbsp; Notice that we could have arrived at the same result without making a table at all by
        simply multiplying the number of choices for the appetizer (3) by the number of choices for the main course (5).
        We generalize this technique as the <em>Multiplication Principle</em>, or sometimes called the Basic Counting
        Rule:</p>
      <div class="definition">
        <h4>Multiplication Principle</h4>
        <p>If we are asked to choose one item from each of two separate categories where there are <em>m</em> items in
          the first category and <em>n</em> items in the second category, then the total number of available choices is
          <em>m&nbsp;</em><strong>&middot;&nbsp;</strong><em>n</em>.</p>
        <p>This is sometimes called the Fundamental Counting Principle or Basic Counting Rule.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 3</h3>
        <p>There are 21 novels and 18 volumes of poetry on a reading list for a college English course. How many
          different ways can a student select one novel and one volume of poetry to read during the quarter?&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>There are 21 choices from the first category and 18 for the second, so there are
          21&nbsp;<strong>&middot;</strong>&nbsp;18&nbsp;=&nbsp;378 possibilities.</p>
        <p><a href="http://youtu.be/fROqcu-ekkw?t=1m39s" target="_blank" >Video Solution</a> <em> (1 min 8 secs - CC)</em> Another
          example starts after 2:08 mark on the video.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The Multiplication Principle can be extended when there are more than two categories by applying it repeatedly,
        as we see in the next example. </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 4</h3>
        <p>Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or breadsticks), five
          choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or pasta) and two choices for dessert (pie or
          ice cream). If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different
          meal options do you have?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>There are 3 choices for an appetizer, 5 for the main course and 2 for dessert, so there are <br>
          3<strong>&middot;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>5&nbsp;<strong>&middot;</strong><strong>
          </strong>2&nbsp;=&nbsp;30 possibilities.</p>

      <h2>Permutations</h2>
      <p>The Multiplication Principle can be used to solve a variety of problem types. One type of problem involves
        placing objects in order. We arrange letters into words and digits into numbers, line up for photographs,
        decorate rooms, and more. An ordering of objects is called a permutation.</p>
      <p>To solve permutation problems, it is often helpful to draw line segments for each option. That enables us to
        determine the number of each option so we can multiply. For instance, suppose we have four paintings, and we
        want to find the number of ways we can hang three of the paintings in order on the wall. We can draw three lines
        to represent the three places on the wall.</p>
      <div>

              alt="blank slot times blank slot times blank slot" /></figure>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>There are four options for the first place, so we write a 4 on the first line.</p>

              alt="4 in the first slot times blank slot times blank slot" /></figure>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>After the first place has been filled, there are three options for the second place so we write a 3 on the
        second line.</p>
      <div>
       <div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>After the second place has been filled, there are two options for the third place so we write a 2 on the third
        line. Finally, we find the product.</p>

      <p>For some permutation problems, it is inconvenient to use the Multiplication Principle because there are so many
        numbers to multiply. Fortunately, we can solve these problems using a formula. Before we learn the formula,
        let’s look at two common notations for permutations. If we have a set of <em>n</em> objects and we want to
        choose <em>r</em> objects from the set in order, we write
        <math display="inline">
          <mi>P</mi>
          <mrow>
            <mo>(</mo>

            </mrow>
            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>
        . Another way to write this is
        <math display="inline">
          <mi>n</mi>
          <mi>P</mi>
          <mi>r</mi>

        , a notation commonly seen on computers and calculators. To calculate

          <mo>!</mo>
        </math>
        , the number of ways to line up all <em>n</em> objects. We then divide by
        <math display="inline">

      <p>Let’s see how this works with a simple example. Imagine a club of six people. They need to elect a president, a
        vice president, and a treasurer. Six people can be elected president, any one of the five remaining people can
        be elected vice president, and any of the remaining four people could be elected treasurer. The number of ways
        this may be done is
        <math display="inline">
          <mn>6</mn>

          <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>120</mn>

        . Using factorials, we get the same result.

      <h3>Combinations</h3>
      <p>So far, we have looked at problems asking us to put objects in order. There are many problems in which we want
        to select a few objects from a group of objects, but we do not care about the order. When we are selecting
        objects and the order does not matter, we are dealing with combinations. A selection of <em>r</em> objects from
        a set of <em>n</em> objects where the order does not matter can be written as
        <math display="inline">
          <mi>C</mi>

            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>
        . Just as with permutations,

        can also be written as

          <mi>C</mi>
          <mi>r</mi>

      <p>An earlier problem considered choosing 3 of 4 possible paintings to hang on a wall. We found that there were 24
        ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings in order. But what if we did not care about the order? We would expect a
        smaller number because selecting paintings 1, 2, 3 would be the same as selecting paintings 2, 3, 1. To find the
        number of ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings, disregarding the order of the paintings, divide the number of
        permutations by the number of ways to order 3 paintings. There are

        , or 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings. This number makes sense because every time we are selecting 3
        paintings, we are not selecting 1 painting. There are 4 paintings we could choose not to select, so there are 4
        ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings.

      <p>In the preceding Try it Now problem we assumed that the 19 members of the Defense Subcommittee were chosen
        without regard to party affiliation.&nbsp; In reality this would never happen: if Republicans are in the
        majority they would never let a majority of Democrats sit on (and thus control) any subcommittee.&nbsp; (The
        same of course would be true if the Democrats were in control.)&nbsp; So let's consider the problem again, in a
        slightly more complicated form: </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 12</h3>
        <p>The United States Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members, 15 Republicans and 14 Democrats.
          The Defense Subcommittee consists of 19 members, 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats. How many different ways can
          the members of the Defense Subcommittee be chosen from among the 29 Senators on the Appropriations Committee?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>In this case we need to choose 10 of the 15 Republicans and 9 of the 14 Democrats.&nbsp; There are
          15<em>C</em>10 = 3003 ways to choose the 10 Republicans and 14<em>C</em>9 = 2002 ways to choose the 9
          Democrats. But now what?&nbsp; How do we finish the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suppose we listed all of the possible 10-member Republican groups on 3003 slips of red paper and &nbsp;all of
          the possible 9-member Democratic groups on 2002 slips of blue paper.&nbsp; How many ways can we choose one red
          slip and one blue slip?&nbsp; This is a job for the Multiplication Principle!&nbsp; We are simply making one
          choice from the first category and one choice from the second category, just like in the restaurant menu
          problems from earlier.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>There must be 3003 · 2002 = 6,012,006 possible ways of selecting the members of the Defense Subcommittee.

      <p><strong>The difference between Permutations and Combinations</strong>: In a permutation and combination problem
        you are selecting from the same group with no choice being selected more than once (both have no repetition),
        but with the permutation the selected items must be in an arrangement or ordered list while combinations that
        order for which they are selected is not important.</p>
      <p>A coach selects three players from a team of 8 to represent the team at an award banquet is a combination
        problem as the three players selected do not have to be in any particular order. A problem where a coach select
        3 players from a team of 8, but those three players will be wearing different uniforms would be a permutation
        problem as the same 3 players can be selected in a variety of ways by changing what uniform each wears (here the
        order was based on them having something different ... we could have they were selected and arranged in order
        from #1 to #3.</p>
