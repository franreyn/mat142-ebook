  <h1>Chapter 3 - Modeling Data with Statistics and Algebra</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example, is there a relationship between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship and how strong is it? Is there a relationship between the assets and taxes paid by individuals? </p>
      <p>The type of data described in the examples is <strong>bivariate</strong> data — "bi" for two variables. In reality, statisticians use <strong>multivariate</strong> data, meaning many variables. In this chapter, you will be studying the simplest form of where there are only two variables and look at an algebraic and regression approach to describe the relationship. We will focus only on linear and exponential relationship. "Linear relationships" involves data that fits a line in two dimensions. "Exponential Relationships" involved data that fits a curve in two dimensions with particular property that two consecutive pairs of values one unit from each other have the same ratio.</p>
