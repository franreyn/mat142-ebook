  <h2>Applications with Similar Triangles</h2>
  <p>Geometric shapes, as well as area and volumes, can often be  important in problem solving. In some cases we can solve a problem by working with two dimensional shapes while in others we need to think three dimensional. It is important on many of these to try to draw a diagram to determine which types of formulas you will want to use.</p>
  <p>One strategy for working with some problems is to use the idea of similar triangles. If two triangles have the same angles inside we say they are similar and this means that each side is proportional to each other. That means we can set up a relation between the ratio of two sides between the two triangles as long as those sides come from the same sides corresponding to the same angles.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Properties of Similar Triangles</h4>
    <p>If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding angle measures are equal and their corresponding side lengths are in the same ratio.</p>
    <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/SimilarTriangles.jpg" width="80%" alt="Two triangles are shown. They appear to be the same shape, but the triangle on the right is smaller. The vertices of the triangle on the left are labeled A, B, and C. The side across from A is labeled a, the side across from B is labeled b, and the side across from C is labeled c. The vertices of the triangle on the right are labeled X, Y, and Z. The side across from X is labeled s, the side across from Y is labeled y, and the side across from Z is labeled z. Beside the triangles, it says that the measure of angle A equals the measure of angle X, the measure of angle B equals the measure of angle Y, and the measure of angle C equals the measure of angle Z. Below this is the proportion a over x equals b over y equals c over z"/></figure>

  <p>In the first example you will see a classic problem of measuring the height of an object by setting up a similar triangles.</p>
  <div class="example">

      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>You are curious how tall a tree is, but don&rsquo;t have any way  to climb it.&nbsp; Suppose the tree is casting a shadow that is 15 ft long. A person standing by the tree is 6 ft tall and casts a shadow that is 1.5 ft long. How tall is that tree?</p>
    </div>
    <p>There are several approaches we could take.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll use one based on triangles, which  requires that it&rsquo;s a sunny day. Since the triangle formed by the  tree and its shadow has the same angles as the triangle formed by me and my  shadow, these triangles are called <strong>similar  triangles</strong> and their sides will scale proportionally.&nbsp; In other words, the ratio of height to width  will be the same in both triangles.&nbsp;  Using this, we can find the height of the tree, which we&rsquo;ll denote by <em>h</em>:</p>

  <h2>Review of Measurements</h2>
  <p>When you measure your height or the length of a garden hose, you use a ruler or tape measure. A tape measure might remind you of a line—you use it for linear measure, which measures length. Inch, foot, yard, mile, centimeter and meter are units of linear measure.</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/tapemeasure.jpg" width="70%" alt="A picture of a portion of a tape measure is shown. The top shows the numbers 1 through 5. The portion from the beginning to the 1 has a red circle and an arrow to a picture from 0 to 1 inch, with 1 sixteenth, 1 eighth, 3 eighths, 1 half, and 3 fourths labeled. Above this, it is labeled “Standard Measures.” The bottom of the tape measure shows the numbers 1 through 10, then 1 and 2. The region from the edge to about 3 and a half has a red circle with an arrow pointing to a picture from 0 to 3.5. It is labeled 0, 1 cm, 1.7 cm, 2.3 cm and 3.5 cm. Above this, it is labeled “Metric (S).”"/></figure>
  <p>When you want to know how much tile is needed to cover a floor, or the size of a wall to be painted, you need to know the area, a measure of the region needed to cover a surface. Area is measured is square units. We often use square inches, square feet, square centimeters, or square miles to measure area. A square centimeter is a square that is one centimeter (cm) on each side. A square inch is a square that is one inch on each side.</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/squareinsqaurecm.jpg" width="70%" alt="Two squares are shown. The smaller one has sides labeled 1 cm and is 1 square centimeter. The larger one has sides labeled 1 inch and is 1 square inch."/></figure>
  <p>The image below shows a rectangular rug that is  2  feet long by  3  feet wide. Each square is  1  foot wide by  1  foot long, or  1  square foot (or
    <math display="inline">

    ). The rug is made of  6 squares. The area of the rug is 6  square feet.</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/sixsquarefootrug.jpg" width="20%" alt="A rectangle is shown. It has 3 squares across and 2 squares down, a total of 6 squares."/></figure>
  <p>When you measure how much it takes to fill a container, such as the amount of gasoline that can fit in a tank, or the amount of medicine in a syringe, you are measuring volume. Volume is measured in cubic units such as cubic inches or cubic centimeters. When measuring the volume of a rectangular solid, you measure how many cubes fill the container. We often use cubic centimeters, cubic inches, and cubic feet. A cubic centimeter is a cube that measures one centimeter on each side, while a cubic inch is a cube that measures one inch on each side (see below).</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/cubicinchcubiccm.jpg" width="50%" alt="Two cubes are shown. The smaller one has sides labeled 1 cm and is labeled as 1 cubic centimeter. The larger one has sides labeled 1 inch and is labeled as 1 cubic inch."/></figure>
  <p>Suppose the cube in below measures 3 inches on each side and is cut on the lines shown. How many little cubes does it contain? If we were to take the big cube apart, we would find 27 little cubes, with each one measuring one inch on all sides. So each little cube has a volume of 1 cubic inch, and the volume of the big cube is 27 cubic inches.</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side"><img src="images/cube3inonside.jpg" width="25%" alt="A cube is shown, comprised of smaller cubes. Each side of the cube has 3 smaller cubes across, for a total of 27 smaller cubes."/></figure>

  <h2>Solving Applications involving Perimeter and Area</h2>
  <p>Many geometry applications will involve finding the perimeter or the area of a figure. There are also many applications of perimeter and area in everyday life, so it is important to make sure you understand what they each mean.</p>
  <p>Picture a room that needs new floor tiles. The tiles come in squares that are a foot on each side—one square foot. How many of those squares are needed to cover the floor? This is the area of the floor.</p>
  <p>Next, think about putting new baseboard around the room, once the tiles have been laid. To figure out how many strips are needed, you must know the distance around the room. You would use a tape measure to measure the number of feet around the room. This distance is the perimeter.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Perimeter and Area</h4>
    <p>The <strong>perimeter</strong> is a measure of the distance around a figure.</p>
    <p>The <strong>area</strong> is a measure of the surface covered by a figure.</p>
  </div>
  <p>It may be helpful to recall some formulas for areas and  perimeter of a few basic two dimensional shapes.</p>

      <h3>Example 4</h3>
      <p>You are painting a room that has the following wall dimensions: 9 ft by 18 ft, 9 ft by 14 ft, 9 ft by 14 ft, and 9 ft by 5 ft. On one wall there is a large picture window with dimensions 8 ft by 4 ft. The paint that was purchased states it covers approximately 350 square feet per gallon. If we assume it takes two coats of paint, then how many gallons of paint is needed?</p>

    <p>If we know the square footage needed to paint, then dividing through by the coverage amount per gallons will give us the total number of gallons needed for painting the room. This will put on a single coat of paint, so doubling that value gives us the number of gallons to put on two coats of paint.</p>
    <p>Find the area for each wall and then add those totals together to give the total coverage amount. Since we don't want to paint the window area subtract out the area of the window to give a final square footage of area that needs to be painted. </p>

    <p>The total area of all the walls is equal to the sum of each wall area or 162+126+126+45&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;459&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>.

    <p>Divide this total coverage area by 350 and double this value to find the total amount of paint that should be purchased. Be careful to not round until the very end as you may end up overestimating the amount of paint needed.</p>

    <p>The result is we need 2.44 gallons. Since paint is typically sold by the quart, gallon, or five gallon container we can round up and purchase 3 gallons. The extra that is left over can then be saved and used for touch ups if needed in the future.</p>

  <p>If a shape is irregular one strategy is to break it up into basic shapes to determine the area or perimeter from the basic forms. We did this with our last examples without mentioning that in the process when subtracting out the area of the window to find the total area of interest. </p>

      <h3>Example 5</h3>
      <p>A high school track is shaped like a rectangle with a semi-circle (half a circle) on each end. The rectangle has length 105 meters and width 68 meters. Find the area enclosed by the track. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.</p>
      <p><img src="images/image_of_race_track.jpg" width="250" height="118" alt="rectangle shape with half circles attached at opposite ends"></p>
    </div>
    <p>We will break the figure into a rectangle and two semi-circles. The area of the figure will be the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the semicircles.</p>
    <p><img src="images/image_of_race_track_with_dimensions.jpg" width="250" height="118" alt="Rectangle shape with half circles attached at opposite ends. Diameter is same as height of rectangle 68 meters and length of rectangle 105 meters"></p>
    <p>The rectangle has a length of 105 m and a width of 68 m. The semi-circles have a diameter of 68 m, so each has a radius of 34 m. To find the area of the semicircle we take half the area of a circle (since we have two of these we will eventually just end up with the total area of a circle). Also in the work make sure to now round &pi; until after the multiplication process (otherwise rounding errors will be introduced into those final results). </p>

  <p>The volume, <strong>V</strong>, of any rectangular solid is the product of the length, width, and height.</p>

  </math>
  <p>We could also write the formula for volume of a rectangular solid in terms of the area of the base. The area of the base, <strong>B</strong>, is equal to length×width.</p>

  <p>We can substitute <strong>B</strong> for <strong>L</strong>&middot;<strong>W</strong> in the volume formula to get another form of the volume formula.</p>

  <p>We now have another version of the volume formula for rectangular solids. Let’s see how this works with the 4×2×3 rectangular solid we started with.</p>
  <figure class="side-by-side" style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/rectangular_solid_together_with_Volume_calculation.jpg" alt="An image of a rectangular solid is shown. It is made up of cubes. It is labeled as 2 by 4 by 3. Beside the solid is V equals Bh. Below this is V equals Base times height. Below Base is parentheses 4 times 2. The next line says V equals parentheses 4 times 2 times 3. Below that is V equals 8 times 3, then V equals 24 cubic units." width="50%">
    <figcaption>Volume of the rectangular solid is the area of the base multiplied by the height.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>To find the surface area of a rectangular solid, think about finding the area of each of its faces. How many faces does the rectangular solid above have? You can see three of them.</p>

  <p>The surface area <strong>S</strong> of the rectangular solid shown in Figure below is 52 square units.</p>
  <p>In general, to find the surface area of a rectangular solid, remember that each face is a rectangle, so its area is the product of its length and its width (see Figure below). Find the area of each face that you see and then multiply each area by two to account for the face on the opposite side.</p>

    <figcaption>For each face of the rectangular solid facing you, there is another face on the opposite side. There are 6 faces in all.</figcaption>

  <p>1. b=12 and x=6</p>
  <p>5. L=15 in</p>
  <p>9. H=12 m</p>
  <p>13. Perimeter = 48 and Area = 110</p>
  <p>17. S = 374 ft<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>19. If you pick a Square piece of paper they will have equal  volume (that&rsquo;s the only way for them to be equal &hellip; since a typical sheet of  paper is not square go ahead and try this with some popcorn and see what  happens &hellip; the rest is the math for a standard 8.5&rsquo;&rsquo;x11&rsquo;&rsquo; sheet of paper). </p>
  <p>Fold so the height is the long side of 11&rsquo;&rsquo; </p>
  <p>Radius is not 8.5&rsquo;&rsquo; (remember radius is distance from center  to edge &hellip; we know the circumference of the base is 8.5&rsquo;&rsquo;). Find &ldquo;r&rdquo;.</p>
